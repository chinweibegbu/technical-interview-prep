# Solution Reflections
**Reflection Guide**:
* "*Initial Approach*" covers my initial approach(es)
* "*Solution Approach*" covers the approach I used that was accepted by all Leetcode testcases
* "*Optimal Approach*" covers an approach I saw in the submissions which I deemed to be more intuitive or easier than mine
* A single asterisk (*) by a point is used to indicate that an analysis as based on a Google search
* A double question mark (??) by a point is used to indicate a lack of trust in my personal analysis

## Tree Problems

### #100 Same tree
⌛08:35:97 &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; See problem [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

* Solution Approach: {RECURSIVE} Store BFS traversal of each tree in a list. Return true if the lists are the same and false if there ay discrepancy as they are being traversed. Before all this, if both trees are empty, automatically return true + if only one tree is empty, automatically return false → **O(n)**, **O(n)**
* Optimal Approach: ?? → **O(??)**, **O(??)**
