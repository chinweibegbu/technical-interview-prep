# Solution Reflections
**Reflection Guide**:
* "*Initial Approach*" covers my initial approach(es)
* "*Solution Approach*" covers the approach I used that was accepted by all Leetcode testcases
* "*Optimal Approach*" covers an approach I saw in the submissions which I deemed to be more intuitive or easier than mine
* A single asterisk (*) by a point is used to indicate that an analysis as based on a Google search
* A double question mark (??) by a point is used to indicate a lack of trust in my personal analysis
* --:--:-- in the time slot means that I couldn't solve it on my own
* 00:00:00 in the time slot means that I had already solved it before doing the Leetcode 150
